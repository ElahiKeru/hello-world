learning github functionality

Hello World, I suppose.

I'm a programmer working professionally for a company in Wisconsin, and was looking at Git functionality as a place to store hobby programs more than anything else. As stated in my profile I'm interested in learning about advanced programming concepts and optimization of code structures as I've only ever had a college education on programming which I feel is hardly sufficient.
